# Testing-OpenCV

This repository contains a collection of files and experiments focused on **deepening studies in the OpenCV library using C++**.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to explore and test **computer vision concepts** and **OpenCV functionalities** in a practical and experimental way, serving as a learning and reference space.

## Technologies
- **C++**
- **OpenCV**

## Repository Structure
The repository includes:
- Source files with OpenCV experiments
- Tests related to image processing and computer vision algorithms
- Exploratory implementations for learning purposes

## How to Use
1. Install [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) on your system  
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberdebb/Testing-OpenCV.git
   ```
3. Compile and run the examples using your preferred C++ compiler and OpenCV setup.
